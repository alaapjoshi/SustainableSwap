# Intro:

SustainableSwap is an innovative e-commerce platform designed to reduce electronic waste by giving users a way to sell spare parts from devices like phones, computers, and tablets instead of throwing them away. The platform helps users earn money while promoting sustainability. Built with React Native and Firebase, SustainableSwap is fast, secure, and easy to use, allowing sellers to upload parts with detailed information so buyers can quickly find what they need. Beyond being a marketplace, it also educates users about e-waste and encourages collective action toward a more sustainable future.

# Pages Description:

## Repair Shops:

This page uses the Google Maps API to fetch all the electronic repair shops within a 5000 meter radius of the user's current location. This information is then displayed on a map along with additional information about each shop, such as its name, address, and phone number. This page allows users to easily locate nearby repair shops and gather relevant information about them, making it a convenient tool for those in need of electronic repair services. The map interface provides a visual representation of the shops' locations, helping users to easily navigate to their desired destination.

## Check:

Our "Value Your Device" page allows users to determine the value of their electronic device by inputting its components and condition. The page uses an algorithm to provide an estimated value based on current market trends. Additionally, users can check how many people are currently searching for that particular device, providing a more accurate valuation. This page is designed to help users make informed decisions when selling or trading in their electronic devices.

## Upload:

The upload screen of our app allows users to submit information about their devices and upload images of it. Once the user fills in the device information such as device name, parts, notes, price, condition, type, and location (latitude and longitude), the user can upload images of the device. The images are uploaded to Firebase Storage, which is a cloud-based storage system that can store and serve user-generated content, such as images and videos. The rest of the device information is stored in Firebase Firestore, which is a NoSQL document database hosted by Google. Firestore allows for real-time synchronization of data between clients and servers, making it easy for users to access and update their device information from multiple devices. By using these two Firebase services together, we are able to provide a seamless and efficient uploading process for our users.

## Buy

The Buy page in our app displays a list of devices that people are looking to sell. Each device is represented by a card that displays its image, device name, and asking price. Users can scroll through the list and click on a card to view more information about the device, such as its condition, location, and parts included. This information is pulled from our Firestore database, which is a NoSQL database hosted by Google. If the user is interested in purchasing the device, they can contact the seller directly through the app. Our app provides a convenient way for users to browse and purchase electronic devices from other individuals in their local area.

## Sell:

The sell page of our app allows users to list their electronic devices for sale. To sell a device, the user must fill out a form that includes details such as the device name, parts, notes, price, condition, type, latitude, longitude, and images. Once the form is completed, the user can upload their images to a Firebase database and the rest of the information to a Firestore database. The listed devices are then displayed on the buy page, where other users can browse through the available devices. When a user clicks on a device, they are taken to a new page with more detailed information about the device, including the seller's contact information. This feature provides a convenient platform for users to sell their devices to others within their community.
